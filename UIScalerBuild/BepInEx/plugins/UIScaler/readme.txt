# UI Scaler v0.1.1

UI Scaler is a temporary mod that allows you to change the size of the game's user interface via a slider in the settings menu. This is handy if you're playing on a bigger or smaller than average monitor. The default size is 80% of the original, but you can set it to anywhere between 75% and 120% of the original size.

As soon as the built-in UI scaling option is online I will be discontinuing UI Scaler. Please let me know about any bugs until then!


# Installation

Open the game folder by right-clicking on the game in your Steam library, selecting "Manage," and then clicking "Browse local files."
